# EcoPlay 🌱

EcoPlay is a gamified web application that turns your everyday eco-friendly actions into a rewarding journey. Track your activities, build streaks, earn points, and watch your virtual garden flourish as you make a real-world impact.

## About The Project

EcoPlay is designed to make sustainable living fun and engaging. By gamifying eco-friendly actions, we aim to motivate users to adopt more sustainable habits. The core idea is that every positive action you take for the environment, no matter how small, contributes to a larger positive impact. In EcoPlay, these actions are rewarded with points that can be used to purchase and grow a variety of virtual trees in your own personal garden, providing a visual representation of your positive environmental contributions.
